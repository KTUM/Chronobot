# Chronobot
My osu bot project. Huge Thank you to Uhut for helping me with the basics and setting up the bot at first because I was sort of retarded and didnt know what typescript was.

This project will probably remain closed source for a very long time due to me hating the fact of sharing code that i wrote with others just to make knock offs and call it 
their own. You can easily visit https://docs.ripple.moe/docs/api and just search up any discordJS vid to make a bot similar to this one. Please and I say this PLEASE learn 
the basics of the language and library that you are going to use the for the discord bot may that be JS, TS, etc. because if not it will be a pain in the ass trying to do
something you have minimal to no knowledge on. Also if you have your own API like ChronoAPI for example try to avoid using it unless you know how to it works because the 
ripple docs will not cover it and you might be lost if you arent familiar with the language. 

# Quick Disclaimer
This only works on ripple/ainu based servers and not asashi or gulag so if you have a gulag or asashi just dont even build the bot 

# Conclusion

Never fucking code an osu server or anything related to it, its a pain in the ass and a waste of your time :), please find friends enjoy life and stay away from this. Goodluck
and if you chose to make a server and use this bot I feel sorry for you
