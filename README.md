# Chronobot
My osu bot project. Huge Thank you to Uhut for helping me with the basics and setting up the bot at first because I was sort of retarded and didnt know what typescript was. If you would like to use this bot for your own ripple based server (doubt it) visit https://docs.ripple.moe/docs/api where you can learn where and how to get data from your API and display it using commands on discord. Also visit https://www.youtube.com/c/WornOffKeys to learn the WOK commands library if you chose to use it.
# Quick Disclaimer (for the retards who coudnt read the second sentence)
This only works on ripple/ainu based servers and not asashi or gulag so if you have a gulag or asashi just dont even build the bot.
The ripple docs will only work for ripple APIs so if you are using your own like chronoAPI for example you are on your own.
To use the bot on your discord server remember to change the guild1 id to the one of your server in the index.ts file.
Change the base url to the domain of your website so it would be osu.server_url.whatever.
This bot does not work for bancho scores so just dont try it unless you add the parameters for it which can be found at the osu API v2 wiki https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu%21api and the v1 https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki
